# lists

dlist:
all functions should handle being given a null pointer
should return error if trying to pop empty list 
return error if malloc fails 

i should make some tail pointer optimizations

could implement swap()

doubly linked lists havent really been implemented

should implement a way to walk through the list in reverse

slist_pushback() doesnt work when list is empty

do better error handling (exit(), atexit(), assert()), always return error code, and return output through a pointer
