# lists

tail: insert() only needs to update tail if item was pushed to the back of the list

tail: should optimize all functions with use of tail pointer

all functions should handle being given a null pointer

could implement swap()

doubly linked lists havent really been implemented

should implement a way to walk through the list in reverse

slist_pushback() doesnt work when list is empty
